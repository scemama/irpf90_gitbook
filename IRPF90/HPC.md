Coarray Fortran support
=======================

When the ``--coarray`` option is given, all the entities are
co-arrays in the [CoArray Fortran (CAF)](http://www.co-array.org/)
language extension, defined as ``[*]``. Therefore, it is possible 
for any process image to access the IRP entities of all the other images.
