Introduction to IRPF90
======================

As we have seen in the previous section, the IRP method is very powerful, but
it requires a lot of discipline. IRPF90 is a tool that will write all the
boilerplate IRP code for you, keeping your source code clear. It will also
write Makefiles, documentation man pages, introduce compiler directives for
code optimization, etc...
