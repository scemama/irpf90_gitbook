IRPF90
======

[IRPF90](http://irpf90.usp-tlse.rf) is a Fortran code generator.
Schematically, the programmer only writes computation kernels, and IRPF90
generates the "glue code" that will link all these kernels together to produce
the expected result, handling all the relationships between the variables. In
this way, even large codes can still be under control.
